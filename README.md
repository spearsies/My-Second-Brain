# 🧠 My Second Brain — Obsidian Vault

Welcome to **My Second Brain**, a personal knowledge management system inspired by Tiago Forte’s PARA method and the principles of digital minimalism. This vault is designed to streamline creative workflows, professional development, and lifelong learning through structured, intentional note-taking.

> *“The system you use to manage information must be so effortless that it liberates your focus rather than constraining it.”* – Tiago Forte

## 📁 Vault Structure

This vault is organized around the **PARA** framework:

| Section     | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Projects** | Active, short-term efforts with clear outcomes (e.g., job search, branding revamp) |
| **Areas**    | Long-term responsibilities and standards (e.g., health, finances, professional development) |
| **Resources** | Reference material, inspiration, and learning (e.g., cybersecurity notes, design ideas) |
| **Archive**  | Completed or inactive items, stored for future reference |
